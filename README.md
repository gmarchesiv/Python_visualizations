# Python_visualizations

This notebook explores commercial airplane flight delays in the United States from 2011 to 2020 using Python's visualization capabilities in Matplotlib and Seaborn. The dataset contains flight statistics for all airports in the United States. Each observation is reported by month, year, airport and airline. Flights can be categorized as ontime, delayed, cancelled or diverted. Flight delays are attributed to five causes: carrier, weather, NAS, security and late aircraft.This work analyses the data through the lenses of seasonality, airport traffic, and airline performance.

The data was downloaded from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp. 

The clean dataset contains 158,102 observations. I have uploaded the compressed rar file to the repository. 

The data is analyzed using the following visualizations: 

- Bar chart
- Lollipop chart
- Tree maps 
- Line plot
- Histogram
- Histogram subplots
- Horizontal stacked bar chart
- Ranked horizontal bar chart
- Box plot
- Pareto chart - double axis
- Marginal histogram 
- Pie charts
- Scatter plot
- Violin plot
- Map chart
- Linear regression

The repository also holds the jupyter notebook and the html summary presentation.
